## 📘 About the Repository

This repository builds upon original coursework from the JHU Applied GEN AI program. While the foundation of each notebook is rooted in their official curriculum, I’ve taken a step further by:

* ✨ Enhancing project depth through innovative approaches
* 💡 Expanding the scope beyond the course requirements
* 🔍 Injecting my own vision and problem-solving strategies
* 🚧 Pushing the boundaries of what each project initially set out to achieve
* 🔄 Redesigning and rewriting some projects from scratch while preserving their central ideas
